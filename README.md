- This resposiroty contains the m files for the final term report of Digital Image Processing for 2019-2020Year winter semester.
Basically, the project demands an enhancemnt algorithm for processing some DR images. 
- The algorithm combines: 
   1. GLG(gray level grouping) 
   2. High frequency emphasis filtering
The processed images, compared to the original, experienced some improvement on the visual quality. However, there is still substantial room for modification and upgrade in the algorithm and the programming itself.
